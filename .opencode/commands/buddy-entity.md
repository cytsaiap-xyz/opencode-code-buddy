Use the `buddy_create_entity` tool to create a new entity in the knowledge graph.

The user wants to record: $ARGUMENTS

Please determine:
- Entity name
- Type (decision, feature, component, file, bug_fix, lesson, pattern, technology)
- Key observations/facts

Then call `buddy_create_entity` with these values.
